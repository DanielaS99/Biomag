This repository is part of the paper: Design and Prototyping of an Automated Laboratory Equipment for the Reuse of Immobilized Systems in Hydrolysis and Fermentation Experiments. It contains: Codes, videos, and diagrams to replicate the device building.

## Codes: 

  Magnetic field of an electromagnets array. Python code for mathematical model
  
  ESP32 Multitasking Code for the whole system control including variables: Temperature, magnetic field, pH, and agitation. 
  
## Plans:

  Mechanical parts for the 3D printed parts

  General measures of the assembly
  
  Part list of the assembly (3D parts)
  
  Electronic connections (schematic diagram)

## Videos:

  Simulations to explain: magnetic field interaction (discharge), ventilation system, disassemble.
  
  Implementation tests: actuators and sensors, pH regulation, user interface interaction (Evidence)
